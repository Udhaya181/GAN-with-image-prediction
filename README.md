Real-world scenarios often present challenges in the form of noisy, low-resolution, or poorly
illuminated images, which can severely impact the efficacy of face recognition algorithms. The
inherent complexity of facial features and the subtle interplay of details necessitate clear and
high-quality images for accurate recognition. The quest to address this critical issue has led
researchers to explore innovative approaches, leveraging the power of deep learning techniques
to enhance image quality and, consequently, boost the performance of face recognition
systems.

In this pursuit, we present a cutting-edge solution that harnesses the synergistic capabilities
of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to
elevate the quality of facial images and subsequently improve face recognition accuracy. Our
method builds upon the foundation of GANs, which have demonstrated remarkable prowess in
generating realistic and high-fidelity images. By introducing a dedicated CNN-based
enhancement module into this framework, we further refine the generated images, accentuating
essential facial attributes while diminishing noise and artifacts.

The primary objective of this research is to demonstrate how our GAN-CNN fusion model
can effectively address the challenges posed by suboptimal input images in the context of face
recognition.
This project is divided into three parts Generating a de-noised images, developing a best Face
recognition CNN model and making a pipeline by fusing the both model. Let we look in it one
by one.
